Hi, I’m Yilin (Dylan) Wang—a Ph.D. student in the Lyles School of Civil & Construction Engineering at Purdue University and a former Machine Learning Engineer at Intel. My research focuses on intelligent transportation systems and connected & automated vehicles (CAVs), especially traffic state estimation, vehicle trajectory analysis, and cooperative driving using deep learning and optimization. I integrate multi-modal data (e.g., UAV videos, loop detectors, V2X) with ML to enhance mobility, safety, and system optimality, and I’ve led projects funded by agencies like FHWA, MDOT, and CCAT. I’m passionate about turning rigorous research into deployable systems that improve real-world transportation networks.

About Me

#Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
