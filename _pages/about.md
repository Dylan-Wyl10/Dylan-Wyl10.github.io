Hi, I’m Yilin (Dylan) Wang—a Ph.D. student in the Lyles School of Civil & Construction Engineering at Purdue University. 


About Me
======
I got my Banchelor from Tongji University and Master of Science from Carnegie Mellong University. Now I am working as a research assistant in Lyles School of Civil Engineering in Purdue University. My advisor is [Dr.Yiheng Feng](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CCE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=244000).

You can find my CV here: [Yilin Wang's Resume](../assets/Resume_YilinWang.pdf)

My research focuses on intelligent transportation systems and connected & automated vehicles (CAVs), especially traffic state estimation, vehicle trajectory analysis, and cooperative driving using deep learning and optimization. I integrate multi-modal data (e.g., UAV videos, loop detectors, V2X) with ML to enhance mobility, safety, and system optimality, and I’ve led projects funded by agencies like FHWA, MDOT, and CCAT. I’m passionate about turning rigorous research into deployable systems that improve real-world transportation networks.
